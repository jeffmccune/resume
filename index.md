### Education

##### [The Ohio State University](http://www.osu.edu/) - **B.S., Computer Science & Engineering**

<br/>

##### Miscellany

Co-Author of [Pro Puppet][Pro Puppet].

Invited Speaker at Apple WWDC, MacConf, PuppetConf (multiple), DevOps Days (multiple).

##### Fit

I'm a senior developer with a strong background in systems administration and
operations.  I'm well suited to applying creativity to solve technical
challenges requiring coordination across teams.

My focus is not on management, but I am comfortable in mentorship and technical
leadership positions.  I'm actively looking for a role that allows me to help
others learn and grow along their own path.

I am accustomed to working in distributed and asynchronous environments with
peers who are self starters.  I enjoy in-person and remote pair programming,
particularly when mentoring junior engineers or learning a new language.

I am happy living in Portland, OR.  Offers from organizations outside of
Portland should be for remote positions with a company having experience with
remote senior developers.

My compensation requirements vary based on the company, the social impact of the
work, the people I work with, the problems to be solved, etc...

Realistic offers include competitive salary, equity, comprehensive benefits,
liberal vacation policies, the opportunity for conference travel, and support
for the costs of equipment, data, and office space.
